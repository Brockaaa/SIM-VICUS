/*! An example keyboard/mouse handler implementation.
	When a keyboard key has been pressed, the corresponding's key state is updated, same
	when it is release (in this case the state will be "was pressed" until cleared). This
	"was pressed" state is needed in those cases, where a delay of state requesting on the
	client side causes a keyPress and keyRelease Sequence to happen before the states
	where checked.

	In addition, when a mouse button is pressed, the corresponding position is stored, so
	that a mouse move delta kann be determined.

	The handler monitors only keys that it was told to monitor. Mouse buttons are all monitored.
	Modification keys are used just as any other key.

	State management:
	- the states of pressed keys are remembered in state WasPressed until clearWasPressedKeyStates() is called
	- the mouse position is updated in mouseDelta(), which requires the new mouse cursor position to update
	  the mouse position for the next call cycle

	\code
	// usage pattern

	// ... some change of state is registered during the event loop

	// evaluate input handler state

	// process all keys and check if they are either held or where pressed

	if (m_inputHandler.keyDown(Qt::Key_W)) {
		...
	}

	// get and reset mouse delta (pass current mouse cursor position)
	QPoint mouseDelta = m_inputHandler.mouseDelta(QCursor::pos());

	// compute mouse speed
	static const float rotatationSpeed   = 0.1f; // in space units/frame

	float yRot = rotationSpeed * mouseDelta.y();

	...

	// finally, reset "WasPressed" key states
	m_inputHandler.clearWasPressedKeyStates();
	m_inputHandler.resetMouseDelta();
