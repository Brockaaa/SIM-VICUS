/*! This object is painted when new subsurfaces are being created.

	Uses the same shader for opaque and transparent geometries.

	Buffer contains data for the partially-transparent geometries (those are
	painted with a little offset to avoid z-level fighting). Also, the outlines
	of the geometries are drawn (with lines) and the base-lines of the selected
	surfaces.

	Vertex-buffer holds first vertexes of generated surfaces. Then vertexes of the
	base-line polygons. Color buffer contains associated colors.

	Index-buffer order is:
	- triangle indexes for m_nTriangles triangles of transparent new surfaces (drawn in
	  renderTransparent()
	- line indexes for m_nLines lines (drawn in renderOpaque())
