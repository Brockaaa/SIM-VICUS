/*! Draws the mini version of the local coordinate system.
	The coordinate system object is composed of several objects, and only some of them are shown
	together.

	Regular coordinate system object (drawn with SHADER_COORDINATE_SYSTEM):
	- one big sphere in the middle          indexBufferObject 0
	- one opaque cylinder per axis          indexBufferObject 1-3
	- one small sphere at each axis end     indexBufferObject 4-6

	After that (drawn with SHADER_TRANSPARENT_GEOMETRY):
	- a plane in the background

	The geometry up to the plane is drawn using triangle strips with index-based drawing.
	The plane is being drawn with drawArrays().
