	Rubberband Object is created to select Objects inside the Vic3DScene via a rubberband rectancle.
	It draws an OpenGl Rectancle and handles correct coloring based on Selection (Green) / Deselection (Red).
	When Touch Mode ist used the Rectancle is also rendered with Alpha 0.5 to give a user Feedback and to distinguish
	all 4 different modes more easily.
	It also creates and pushes an undo-action with all changed selection states of VICUS::Objects.

	TODO: Select/Deselect also Network elements.

	4 different Selection/Deselection modes exist:
	1) Top -> Down | Left  -> Right : SELECTION MODE & TOUCH MODE -> Select all Objects touched by Rubberband.
	2) Top -> Down | Right -> Left  : SELECTION MODE & INCLUDE MOODE -> Select all Objects fully included by Rubberband
	3) Down -> Top | Right -> Left  : DESELECTION MODE & TOUCH MOODE -> Deselect all Objects touched by Rubberband.
	4) Down -> Top | Right -> Left  : DESELECTION MODE & INCLUDE MOODE -> Deselect all Objects fully included by Rubberband

		2) Take Surface and Project all points in NDC via inverted WorldToView-Matrix
		3) Take ClipperLib construct a Path with all projected Points in NDC.
			(Only IntPoints exists in Clipper, so we scale by SCALE_FACTOR)
		4) CLip Rubberband Polygon with Projected Surface Polygon
		5) INCLUDE MODE:	De-/Select Object if absolute Clipping Area of Projected Surface with
						Rubberband Surface is the same as the Area of the projected Surface.
		   TOUCH MODE:		De-/Select Object if absolute Clipping Area of Projected Surface with
						Rubberband Surface is > 0;
		   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		   MIND:	We compare always the scaled clipping areas, so that hopefully also nearly orthogonal
				surfaces to near plane contain a small projected area.
		   TODO:	If this is not always working we have to check before if we sometimes get
				a line and then we check 1) Both points inside Clipping Poly and 2) Line cuts one Line Of
				Clipping Polygon.
		   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		7) Construct undo-action with selection changed Objects
		8) push undo action.
