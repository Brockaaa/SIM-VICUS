/*! An object to hold information on what to pick and also store the result.
	Basically, whenever you ask the scene to pick a point (after a mouse click, or if the mouse
	cursor has moved), configure such a pick object and call Scene::pick(obj).

	The pick object will now process all objects in the scene and for all activated for picking
	perform a collision test with the line-of-sight. All objects/planes that are hit by the
	line-of-sight are stored in the pick result candidate vector m_candidates.

	Afterwards you can access the data. If you are only interested in the nearest point, you
	can use the convenience function nearestHit() to retrieve the hit closest to the near plane.
