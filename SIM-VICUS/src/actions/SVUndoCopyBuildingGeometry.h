/*! Undo action for copying buildings, building levels, rooms, surfaces and or subsurfaces.

	The undo-action is actually very generic - it modifies the entire vector of buildings and
	all compoment and subsurface component instances.

	To simplify generation of the undo-action data, there are several static convience functions that assist in
