/*! Base class for all worked threads in the user interface.

	In addition to re-implementing QThread::run() you should also
	implement stop() such, that a call to this function from
	another thread will make the thread return from run() very
	very shortly afterwards. A good approach is to set a flag within
	stop and poll this flag repeatedly within run().

	Each thread implementation works in its own memory space. It is forbidden
	to access GUI/project memory during thread execution. Instead, implement
	fetch() (which is called from the GUI thread just before run() is triggered)
	and copy all relevant data to your thread object. Then, once run() is completed
	successfully your implementation of store() is called (also from the GUI thread)
	which allows you to copy all results of your threaded operation into the
	main applications memory.
