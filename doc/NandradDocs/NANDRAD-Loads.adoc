# Climatic loads

## Overview

- time-dependent
- climate data file reading
- location settings in climate data file
- location settings in NANDRAD project file -> override rules
- albedo
- radiation sensors

## Implementation

The `Loads` model is a pre-defined model that is always evaluated first whenever the time point has changed. It does not have any other dependencies.

It provides all resulting variables as `constant` (during iteration) result variables, which can be retrieved and utilized by any other model.

With respect to solar radiation calculation, during initialization it registers all surfaces (with different orientation/inclination) and provides an ID for each surface. Then, models can request direct and diffuse radiation data, as well as incidence angle for each of the registered surfaces.
