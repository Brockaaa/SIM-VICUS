This document contains a description of the various implemented models and the parametrization in the NANDRAD project file. It is therefore both input reference and model description.

## Overview

### Simulation time and absolute time reference

- how is the simulation time defined
- how is the absolute time obtained (start year and start time)
- how are cyclic annual simulations handled, how are continuous multi-year simulations handled
