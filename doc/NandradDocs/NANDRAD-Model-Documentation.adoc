## Overview

### Simulation time and absolute time reference

- how is the simulation time defined
- how is the absolute time obtained (start year and start time)
- how are cyclic annual simulations handled, how are continuous multi-year simulations handled

## Models

### Climatic Loads

- time-dependent
- climate data file reading
- location settings in climate data file
- location settings in NANDRAD project file -> override rules
- albedo
- radiation sensors


### Schedules

- time-depdendent
- mapping
