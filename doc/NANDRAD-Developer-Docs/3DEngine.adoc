## Camera

- world-2-view-translation = m_projection * m_camera * m_transform
- transform only for "movable objects" (e.g. objects in selection)

- Local coordinate system of camera = left handed coordinate system with y-axis pointing downwards and z-axis pointing towards user
   
  + right = towards right of screen
  + up = pointing downwards
  + forward = towards the viewer
  
- camera object without translation and rotation -> x and y coordinates map to i-j coordinates of screen (0,0 top left; 1,1 bottom right), so that point x,y,z = (-50,-200,0) becomes i,j = (-100, 400) (bottom left) in screen coordinates.

## Data transfer

- original geometry in object coordinates (world coordinate for now)
- opaque geometry = planes

### Primitive Assembly

- planes:
    * type triangle
    * type rect
    * type polygon
- plane type affects selection algorithm: triangle/rect trivial; polygon = test individual triangles (more work)

- data on VBO first stored on heap (vector of vertex struct); additional vector for rgba colors
- plane transfer vectors, type-specific transfer:
    * append vertices + colors
    * store element indexes in triangle-strip order
    * append primitive restart index, see https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Rendering#Primitive_Restart

    
- triangles: copy 3 vertices counter-clock-wise; append element indexes +0, +1, +2
- rectangle: copy 4 vertices counter-clock-wise; append element indexes +0, +1, +2; +1 +3 +2

### Triangle Strips

See also explanation in https://www.learnopengles.com/tag/triangle-strips.

:xrefstyle: short

See polygon in <<fig_trianglestrip_polygon>>. Index list to draw the polygon is: 

    1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 4

- First triangle is `1, 2, n` (anti-clock-wise - order of first triangle defines order of the rest). 
- Second triangle is `2, n-1, n` 
- Third triangle is `n, 3, n-1` 
- Fourth triangle is `3, n-2, n-1`

... in an algorithm keep adding indexes until you would duplicate an existing node index

When drawing several triangle strips one after another, we need primitive restart (to have gaps between triangles).

Consider strips in <<fig_trianglestrip_restart>>. Top part of the figure shows two strips where the first strip ends with an _odd numbered_ triangle. Bottom part shows the first strip ending with an _even numbered_ triangle.

## Shaders

Vertex-Layout notation:

* V - single coordinate (e.g. x-coordinate)
* N - component of normal vector
* C - color component (e.g. CCC for RGB)
* T - texture coordinate

### Grid

* Shader-Index: 0
* Vertex-Structure: (VV) = (xz)
* Files: `grid.vert` and `grid.frag` 
* Uniforms (variables):
    -  `worldToView`
    -  `gridColor`
    -  `backColor` (fade-to color)
    - (optional) `farDistance` (fade-to normalization distance)

### Background Objects

Uniform color, no lighting effect, no transparency

* Shader-Index: 1
* Vertex-Structure: (VVVCCC) = (xyzrgb)
* Files: `vertexColor.vert` and `flat.frag`
* Uniforms (variables):
    -  `worldToView`


### Regular Opaque Objects

* Shader-Index: 2
* Vertex-Structure: (VVVNNNCCC) = (xyzNxNyNzrgb)
* Files: `vertexNormalColor.vert` and `specularShading.vert`
* Uniforms (variables):
    -  `worldToView`
    -  `lightPos`
