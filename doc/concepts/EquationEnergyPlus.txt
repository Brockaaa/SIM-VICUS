Forced flow through an opening:

 ̇m_L = ρ_L*A*C_d/( 2*∆P*ρ_{ave})^0.5

where:
̇mL = Air mass flow rate from the upper zone to the lower zone driven by
ρ_L = Air density in the lower zone [kg/m3]
A = Opening area [m2]
C_d = Discharge coeﬀicient [Dimensionless]
ρ_{ave} = Average air density between the lower and up



Linkage models (simple vertical opening with forced and buoyant flow):

The equations used below are available from Walton (1989).
The air density for each node is assumed to be constant. The hydrostatic equation is used to
relate pressures at various heights for each node:

P_n(y) = P_{0,n} − ρ_n*g*y
P_m(y) = P_{0,m} − ρ_m*g*y

where:
P_{0,n}, P_{0,m} = Pressure at nodes (zones) n and m at y = 0, the reference elevation
of the opening [Pa]
ρ_n, ρ_m = Air densities of zones n and m [kg/m3]
P_n, P_m = Reference pressures of zones n and m [Pa]

Orifice equation (Brown and Solvason 1962):
v(y) = C_d * (2*(P_n(y) − P_m(y))/ρ)^0.5

where:
C_d = Discharge coeﬀicient [dimensionless]
ρ = Density of the air going through the opening [kg/m3]

with
Y = (P_{o,n} − P_{0,m})/(g(ρ_n − ρ_m)) or (P_{o,m} − P_{0,n})/(g(ρ_m − ρ_n))

where:
Y = neutral height

When the neutral plane is within the opening, two-way (bi-
directional) flows occur. The total flow through a large opening is the sum of both flows.

 ̇m_{0,Y} = C_d * θ * int_{y=Y}^{y=0} ρ * ν(y) * W dy
 ̇m_{Y,H} = C_d * θ * int_{y=H}^{y=Y} ρ * ν(y) * W dy 
 
When the neutral plane is below or above the large opening, one-way flow occurs.
 ̇m = C_d * θ * int_{y=H}^{y=0} ρ * ν(y) * W dy
 
where:
C_d = Discharge coeﬀicient [dimensionless]
θ = Area reduction factor [dimensionless]
W = Opening width [m]


Forced flow through a crack:

̇m = C_T * C_Q * ∆P^n

where
m = air mass flow (kg/s)
C_Q = air mass flow coefficient (kg/s-Pa^n @ 1 Pa)
C_T = reference condition temperature correction factor (dimensionless)
∆P = pressure difference across crack (Pa)
n = air flow exponent (dimensionless)

C_T =(ρ_o/ρ)^{n-1}*(ν_o/ν)^{2n-1}

where:
ρ = Air density at the specific air temperature and humidity ratio conditions [kg/m3]
ν = Air kinetic viscosity at the specific air temperature condition [m2/s]
ρ_o = Air density at the reference air conditions provided by the object AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ReferenceCrackConditions specified in the field Reference Crack Conditions [kg/m3]
ν_o = Air kinetic viscosity at the reference air temperature provided by the object AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:ReferenceCrackConditions specified in the field Reference Crack Conditions [m2/s]
