This directory contains all kinds of documentation, from conceptional stuff to user/developer documentation.

Developer documentation/user docs and reference documentation is written with AsciiDoctor and afterwards copied to ../docs 
for publishing with github pages.

Run the build.sh scripts in the documentation subdirectories.
Also, run the linkcheck.sh scripts to test, if all cross references are valid.
