# Outputs/Results

In NANDRAD it is possible to retrieve output data for any computed and published quantity, see <<quantities>> for a complete list. Of course, not all quantities are available in all projects - much depends on what kind of models and geometry has been defined.

In order to define an output, the following information is needed:

- an output grid, that defines _when_ outputs are to be written
- the variable/quantity name
- an object list, that selects the object or objects to retrieve data from
- (optional) time handling information, i.e. whether to average values in time or perform time integration
- (optional) target filename

In addition to manually defined outputs, NANDRAD also generate a number log and data files, automatically (see section <<solver_log_files>>).

Outputs are stored in the XML-tag `Outputs`, with the following general structure:

[source,xml]
----
<Outputs>
   ... <!-- global output parameters -->
    
    <Grids>
        ... <!-- Definition of output grids -->
    </Grids>
    
    <Definitions>
        ... <!-- Actual output definitions -->
    </Definitions>
</Outputs>
----

## Global output parameters

The following parameters influence the output file generation:

* `TimeUnit` - the value of this XML-tag holds the time unit to be used in the output files
* `IBK:Flag`:
  - name `BinaryFormat`: if true, files will be written in binary format (see <<binary_outputs>>).

[[output_grids]]
## Output grids

Output grids define _when_ outputs are written. An output grid contains a list of intervals, with an output step size defined for each interval. For example, if you want to have hourly output steps from start to end, you need to define a grid with one interval and a step size parameter of one hour:

.Output grid for entire simulation with hourly steps
====
[source,xml]
----
<Grids>
	<OutputGrid name="hourly">
		<Intervals>
			<Interval>
				<IBK:Parameter name="StepSize" unit="h">1</IBK:Parameter>
			</Interval>
		</Intervals>
	</OutputGrid>
</Grids>
----
====

An output grid is uniquely identified by its name (mandatory XML-attribute `name`). It contains a single child tag `Intervals` which holds one or more intervals. The intervals (XML-tag `Interval`) are expected to follow temporally in consecutive order, optionally with a gap in-between.

Intervals can have up to 3 parameters:

* `Start` - the start time of the interval (see explanation below)
* `End`- the end time of the interval (see explanation below)
* `StepSize` - the distance between outputs within the interval

The parameters are stored in XML-tags of type `IBK:Parameter`, see <<IBK_Parameter>>.

Time points in `Start` and `End` parameters are defined with respect to Midnight January 1st of the year in which the simulation starts.

### Rules

- the `Start` parameter is optional under the following conditions:
    * in the first interval, a missing `Start` parameter is automatically set to 0 (start of the year)
    * in all other intervals, the `End` time of the preceeding interval is taken (see next rule below)
- the end time of an interval is defined, either:
    * by defining the `End` parameter,
    * through definition of the `Start` parameter in next interval
    * through simulation end time (only in last interval)
- the parameter `StepSize` is mandatory in each interval

Basically, it must be clear for the solver when an interval starts and ends, and how long the step size is.

During simulation, an output is written exactly under the following condition:

- t must be in an interval defined by the grid
- the offset t from the start of the interval must be an exact multiple of the step size

.Output grid evaluation
====
Suppose an output interval is defined to start at 12.5 h, with a step size of 2 h. The simulation time shall be t=16.5 h. 
Then 16.5 - 12.5 = 4 h, which is an exact multiple of 2 h. Hence, the output grid is "active" at this simulation time and all
outputs associated with this output grid will be written.
====

There may be gaps between intervals, in which no outputs are written:

.Output grid for daily values in first year and hourly values in third year (beginning at time "2 a")
====
[source,xml]
----
<Grids>
	<OutputGrid name="first_and_last">
		<Intervals>
			<Interval>
				<IBK:Parameter name="StepSize" unit="d">1</IBK:Parameter>
				<IBK:Parameter name="End" unit="a">1</IBK:Parameter>
			</Interval>
			<Interval>
				<IBK:Parameter name="Start" unit="a">2</IBK:Parameter>
				<IBK:Parameter name="StepSize" unit="h">1</IBK:Parameter>
			</Interval>
		</Intervals>
	</OutputGrid>
</Grids>

## Output definitions

Below is an example of an output definition:

.Output of air temperature from all zones in object list 'All zones' and using output grid 'hourly'
[source,xml]
----
<Definitions>
    <OutputDefinition>
    	<Quantity>AirTemperature</Quantity>
    	<ObjectListName>All zones</ObjectListName>
    	<GridName>hourly</GridName>
    </OutputDefinition>
    ... <!-- other definitions -->
</Definitions>
----

The example shows the mandatory child tags of XML-tag `OutputDefinition`. Below is a list of all supported child tags:

[options="header"]
[cols="15%, 85%"]
[width="100%"]
|====================
| XML-tag | Description 
| `Quantity` |  Unique ID name of the results quantity, see also <<quantities>>
| `ObjectListName` |  Reference to an object list that identifies the objects to take results from
| `GridName` |  Reference to an output grid (output time definitions)
| `FileName` |  (optional) Target file name
| `TimeType` |  (optional) Time averaging/integration method
|====================

The ID name of the quantity is the name of the result of a model object, or a schedule or anything else generated by the solver. The corresponding object or objects are selected by an <<object_lists,object list>>. The grid name is the ID name of an <<output_grids, output grid>>.

The `FileName` tag is optioned. It can be used to specifically select the name of an output file. Normally, output file names are generated automatically, depending on the type of output requested.

Lastly, the tag `TimeType` can be used to specifiy time averaging or time integration of variables, see section <<output_time_type>>.


### Variable names and variable lookup rules

Quantities in output definitions define the ID names of the output quantities, optionally including an index notation when a single element of a vectorial quantity is requested. Hereby the following notations are allowed:

- `HeatSource[1]` - index argument is interpreted as defined by the providing models, so when the model provides a vector-valued quantity with model ID indexing, then the argument is interpreted as object ID (otherwise as positional index)
- `HeatSource[index=1]` - index argument is explicitely interpreted as position index (will raise an error when model provides quantity with model ID indexing)
- `HeatSource[id=1]` - index argument is explicitely interpreted as object ID (will raise an error when model provides quantity with positional indexing)


[[output_filenames]]
### Output file names

The following sections describe the rules which determine the output file names.

#### When no filename is given

Target file name(s) are automatically defined.

All outputs a grouped depending on the quantity into:

- states
- fluxes
- loads
- misc

If `Integral` is selected as `TimeType`:

- for quantity of type __fluxes__ the group _flux_integrals_ is used instead,
- for quantity of type __loads__ the group _load_integrals_ is used instead


The outputs are further grouped by output grid name. The final output file name is obtained for each grid and group name:

  - states -> `states_<gridname>.tsv`
  - loads -> `loads_<gridname>.tsv`
  - fluxes -> `fluxes_<gridname>.tsv`
  - fluxes (integrated) -> `flux_integrals_<gridname>.tsv`

[NOTE]
====
There is one special rule: when only one grid is used, the suffix `_<gridname>` is omitted.
====

#### When a filename is given

The quantity is written to the specified file. If there are several output definitions with the same file name, then all quantities are written into the same file, regardless of type.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All output definitions using the same file name must use the *same* grid (same time points for all columns are required!)
====


[[output_time_type]]
### Time types

The tag `TimeType` takes the following values:

- `None` - write outputs as computed at output time
- `Mean`- write value averaged over last output interval
- `Integral` - write integral value

By default (when the tag `TimeType` is not explicitely specified) the values are written as they are computed at the output time (corresponds to `None`). Figure <<fig_timetype>> illustrates the various options.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to note that average values are always averages of the values in the last output interval. So, even if the output unit is `kW/h`, for example  but  
====

### Examples

- Requesting fluxes across construction interfaces: object list must reference interfaces
- Requesting energy supplied to layer in construction instance (floor heating): object list must reference construction instance, variable name must reference heat source + index of heat source (if several in construction): `<Quantity>HeatSource[1]</Quantity>` (first heat source in layer, counting from side A in construction, see <<construction_heat_sources, Heat sources in constructions/layers>>).
