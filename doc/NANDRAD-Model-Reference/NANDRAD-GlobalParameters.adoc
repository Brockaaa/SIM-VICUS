# Global parameters


- parameters controlling how the model operates
- parameters controlling model accuracy
- parameters controlling performance

## Simulation Parameters

### Simulation time and absolute time reference

- how is the simulation time defined
- how is the absolute time obtained (start year and start time)
- how are cyclic annual simulations handled, how are continuous multi-year simulations handled

Example:

[source,xml]
----
<SimulationParameter>
	<IBK:Parameter name="InitialTemperature" unit="C">5</IBK:Parameter>
	<IBK:IntPara name="DiscMaxElementsPerLayer">30</IBK:IntPara>
</SimulationParameter>
----

The following XML-Tags named `IBK:Parameters` with the XML-Attributes `name` and `unit` with the following entries can be defined:
