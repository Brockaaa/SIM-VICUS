# How to get good illustrations

For Web-Display use png, with dimensions 600x420 (at least not much wider than 600 px to avoid scaling in webbrowser and quality loss).

With LibreOffice-Draw create a slide with dimensions: 10 cm wide and export it with 600 px width as png.
For print use svg, which can be exported directly.

For Fonts, use Liberation Sans 18.

File naming:

`image.png`
`image-print.svg`
