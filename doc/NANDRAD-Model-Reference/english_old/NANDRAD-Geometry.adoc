# Zones

In order to model buildings, it is necessary to define the individual rooms with the relevant parameters. A zone defines a well-mixed thermal zone/room with a single/uniform air temperature.

Objects of type `Zone` store all properties needed to compute zone temperature from energy density (the conserved quantity).

|====================
| Attribute  | Description | Format | Usage 
| `id` |  Identifier of the Zone | ({nbsp}>{nbsp}0{nbsp})  | _required_
| `displayName`  |  Display name of the zone. Is needed to find the zone in the data model and in outputs more easily. | string | _optional_
| `type`  
a|  Defines whether zone is balanced and included in equation system.

* `Constant` as zone with constant/predefined temperatures. (schedule)
* `Active` as zone described by a temperature node in space
* `Ground` as ground zone (calculates temperature based on standard) | key | _required_

|====================

For _constant_ zones, the temperature is assumed to
be fixed/predefined whereas in _Active_ zones the temperature is computed (i.e. included in
the model's unknowns). A _Constant_ zone only needs the temperature parameter.

In the following it is described in detail.

[[construction_discretization]]
## Spatial Discretization (Finite Volume Method)

During calculation, each of the constructions is spatially discretized using a grid generation algorithm. This algorithm uses three influential parameters, defined in the <<solver_parameters>> section:

- `DiscMinDx`
- `DiscStretchFactor`
- `DiscMaxElementsPerLayer`

:xrefstyle: short

<<fig_discretization>> illustrates the effect of different stretch factors.

:xrefstyle: basic

[[fig_discretization]]
.Different Discretization Variants depending on DiscStretchFactor Parameter
image::Discretization.png[]

Basically three different grid generation operations are supported:

* **minimal grid:** when `DiscStretchFactor = 0` the algorithm creates one Finite Volume per material layer, except for the boundary elements, which are always split into two (needed for surface value extrapolation). So, for example, a 4-layered construction will result in 6 Finite Volumes.

* *equidistant:* when `DiscStretchFactor = 1` the algorithm generates equally spaced grid elements in each layer, whose thickness is close to, but always less than the `DiscMinDx` parameter. Since material layers may have different widths, a uniform grid element thickness may not be possible throughout the construction. Choose a `DiscMinDx` parameter where all material layer widths are whole-number multiples of this grid element thickness (e.g. __1 mm__)

* *regular grid:* for any `DiscStretchFactor > 1` a regular, variably-spaced grid is generated.

### Regular Grid Generation Algorithm

A regular stretching grid is generated using a double-sided __tanh__-stretching function. The factor `DiscStretchFactor` hereby determines roughly the ratio of first two grid element widths. Naturally, this growth factor varies and goes down to zero in the center of a material layer, but it nicely determines the overall grid detail. A factor of 4 is a good default value.

The parameter `DiscMinDx` defines the maximum width of the outermost grid elements in each layer. Hence, it is indirectly also used to determine the number of grid elements per material layer. With increasing number of grid elements per layer, the outermost grid elements will become smaller. This way, the algorithm determines the number of grid cells (for a given `DiscStretchFactor`), until the generated width if the outermost grid elements is equal or less than the `DiscMinDx` parameter. A minimum element thickness of _2 mm_ is a good default value for very accurate calculations, but a value of _5 mm_ may suffice in many situations (this reducing the number of unknowns and eventually simulation time significantly).

Finally, there is the parameter `DiscMaxElementsPerLayer` that can be used to limit the number of grid elements to be generated in a material layer. This is particularly useful when very thick material layers are present and a large number of grid cells are generated. Often, this accuracy is not needed (for very thick material layers anyways), so limiting the number may be meaningful to speed up calculation. As long as the number of generated grid cells per material layer exceeds `DiscMaxElementsPerLayer` the algorithm will gradually increase the `DiscStretchFactor` until the criterion is fulfilled. The solver will emit a warning message for each construction layer that this adjustment is applied to.

[TIP]
====
As with all numerical solvers employing calculation grids, there is always a compromise between speed and accuracy. A grid sensitiviy study may be helpful, for example by starting with `DiscMinDx = 5 mm` and `DiscStretchFactor = 8` and then gradually reducing the values until the solution does no longer change. For small buildings/models, where performance is not an issue, you may want to use the default values `DiscMinDx = 2 mm` and `DiscStretchFactor = 4`.

[[construction_interfaces]]
# Interfaces (construction boundary conditions)

Interfaces are defining boundary conditions and parameters for the one or two surfaces `InterfaceA` and `InterfaceB` of a constructions instance. If the construction instance defines an adiabatic wall only one interface is needed. All other cases require two interfaces. The `InterfaceA` links the first material layer from the construction type with the assigned zone via the `zoneId`. The `InterfaceB` links the last material layer from the construction type with the `zoneId` of `InterfaceB`.

[[embedded_objects]]
# Embedded objects (windows, doors, openings...)

There can be several embedded object definitions.

.Definition of a window inside a construction instance
[source,xml, indent=0]
====
----
<ConstructionInstance id="1">
	<IBK:Parameter name="Area" unit="m2">12</IBK:Parameter>
    ...
	<EmbeddedObjects>
		<EmbeddedObject id="2000" displayName="A window">
		    <!-- Area parameter is required. -->
			<IBK:Parameter name="Area" unit="m2">8</IBK:Parameter>
		    ...
		</EmbeddedObject>
	</EmbeddedObjects>
</ConstructionInstance>
----
====

Embedded objects must have at least and `Area` parameter defined. This area must not exceed the gross surface area of the construction instance.

An embedded object is further qualified by embedded data objects.

## Windows

A window is composed of a glazing and optionally frame and dividers. Without frame and dividers, the definition for such a window looks like:

.Parameter definition for basic window without frame
[source,xml, indent=0]
====
----
<EmbeddedObject id="2000" displayName="A window">
	<IBK:Parameter name="Area" unit="m2">8</IBK:Parameter>
    <Window glazingSystemID="123"/>
</EmbeddedObject>
----
====

Only the glazing system is referenzed by ID. Glazing systems are defined in the glazing systems database list, see <<glazing_systems>>.

The window may have a frame and/or dividers. These are separate entities because frame and divider material (and hence thermal conductivity across these materials) may be different. These are defined in XML-tags `Frame` and `Divider`:

.Parameter definition for basic window with frame and divider
[source,xml, indent=0]
====
----
<EmbeddedObject id="2000" displayName="A window">
	<IBK:Parameter name="Area" unit="m2">8</IBK:Parameter>
	<Window glazingSystemID="123">
		<Frame materialID="1001">
			<IBK:Parameter name="Area" unit="m2">3</IBK:Parameter>
		</Frame>
		<Divider materialID="1002">
			<IBK:Parameter name="Area" unit="m2">2</IBK:Parameter>
		</Divider>
	</Window>
</EmbeddedObject>
----
====

The material properties (currently only thermal conductivity) of frame and divider elements are taken from the material referenced via ID. 

The actual geometry of frame and divider elements is not important, but their total cross section area must be given as  `Area` parameter.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cross section occupied by frame and divider must not exceed the gross area of the embedded window object. The actual translucent glazing area is computed as difference between embedded object area and frame and divider areas.
====

[NOTE]
====
When the window (or embedded object) is resized, the sizes of frame and divider must be adjusted accordingly. While it would have been possible to define frame and divider cross sections also as relative percentage, still this percentage needs to be updated when the window is resized.
====


### Window shading

It is possible to apply pre-computed shading to both opaque and translucent facade elements. Pre-computed shading is generally defined as global property in the `Location` tag (see <<precomputed_shading>>).

When pre-computed shading is defined, for *each* opaque and translucent surface a factor will be provided.

[NOTE]
====
As described in section <<precomputed_shading>>, the association between provided data columns and object ID is done via identification string, composed from object type and ID number. For example, an embedded object with ID 14 would get the column header/caption _embObj.14_ and a construction instance (opaque surface) with ID 29 would get _conInst.29_.
====

Alternatively or additionally to pre-computed shading it is possible to define controlled shading for the window.

.Parameter definition for controlled shading
[source,xml, indent=0]

----
<Window glazingSystemID="123">
    ...

		<IBK:Parameter name="ReductionFactor" unit="---">0.7</IBK:Parameter>
	</Shading>
</Window>
----
====

The `Shading` needs to be defined with the following XML attributes:

.Attributes
[options="header",cols="20%,60%,^ 10%,^ 10%",width="100%"]
|====================
| Attribute  | Description | Format | Usage

[width="100%"]
|====================
| Name | Unit | Description | Value Range | Usage

.Calculation of the shading factor based on control signal
====
----
ReductionFactor = 80%

Fz depending on control signal: 

1   = full shaded:      Fz = 1 - (1 - 80%) * 1      = 0.8
0   = unshaded shaded:  Fz = 1 - (1 - 80%) * 0      = 1
0.5 = partially shaded: Fz = 1 - (1 - 80%) * 0.5    = 0.9
