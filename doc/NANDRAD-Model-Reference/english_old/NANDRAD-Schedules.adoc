# Schedules

## Overview

Schedules provide purely time-dependent quantities, similar to climatic loads. Different to other results-producing models, schedules generate variables for sets of dependent models. As such, a schedule is formulated for an object list, which selects a set of objects taking the values provided by the schedule.
For example, they are used in the following objects or list of objects:

* **Occupancy rates**, **heat loads**, *clothing factors* in the person load model.
* *Heating/cooling set point temperatures* for thermostat controls
* *Mass flow rates* or *temperature set points* for plant components
* *Electrical power rates* for lighting and electrical devices

For example, a schedule defines a heating set point `HeatingSetPoint` for specific zones like living rooms. These are selected by an object list named "Living room", which selects objects with the type `Zone` and a certain ID range (will be described later in more detail).

There are two possible ways to describe a schedule:

* `ScheduleGroups` 
* `AnnualSchedules`. 

The two options are discussed in detail in <<regularSchedules>> and <<annualSchedules>>. 

Furthermore scheduled data can be handled in two different ways, as

* *Cyclic* data, and
* *Non-cyclic* data.

*Cyclic data* means that schedule values will be repeated after the end of the schedule period. This means, for example, that an annual schedule will be run twice if the simulation time will be set to two years. *Cyclic-data* can be defined by `ScheduleGroups` and `AnnualSchedules`.

*Non-cyclic* data will always be used only once. This is useful if monitored data will be used to set up schedules. Then the simulation needs to be set only for the time span the monitored data is existing. *Non-cyclic* data can only be defined by `AnnualSchedules`.

## Schedule groups

`ScheduleGroup` tags exist both in daily scheme based schedules and annual schedules. They identify the target objects for scheduled parameters. To avoid ambiguity, it is not allowed to define multiple schedule groups with the same object list.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not define multiple `ScheduleGroup` elements with the same object list!

<<ex_ScheduleGroup>> shows such a definition and <<ex_ScheduleGroup_refObjList>> the corresponding object list.

### Daily Cycles

Inside the `ScheduleGroup` several Objects called `Schedule` can be defined. The `Schedule` objects need an XML attribute called `type` with different names for specific day types (see <<tab_ScheduleTypes>>). There must not be two `Schedule` objects with the same `type` inside a `ScheduleGroup`. Within each `Schedule` object a schedule is defined that is applied for all days of the given `type` during the course of a whole year. The following rules apply when constructing schedules.

At first priority the type `AllDays` will set specified daily schedule values (e.g. `HeatingSetPoint`) to all days of the whole year (Priority 0). <<ex_schedule_alldays>> shows such a schedule definition.

After this the `type` named `WeekEnd` and `WeekDay` will, if defined, overwrite the already defined schedule values for only all week days or weekend days (Priority 1). Furthermore the weekdays named `Monday`, `Tuesday`, ... define for which days the schedule values will be overwritten again (Priority 2). This continues with the day type `Holiday` (Priority 3) for the specified holidays inside the `Holidays` object. 

It is possible to define different schedules for individual periods of the year, e.g. regular year and summer vacation period etc.. This way a schedule for the entire year can be defined.

### Daily Cycle Time Intervals

A `DailyCycle` defines how one or more quantities change during the day. The child tag `TimePoints` defines space-separated time points in [h] (hours), and hereby the different time intervals of the day.

If the attribute `interpolation` is `Constant`, then the following rules apply:

- the time points  are interpreted as *start* time of the next interval
- the first time point must be always 0, the last one must be < 24 h,
- the corresponding value is taken as constant during this interval

For example, a time point vector "0 6 20" defines three intervals: 0-6, 6-20, 20-24 and
the data table must contain exactly 3 values.

If the attribute `interpolation` is `Linear`, then the following rules apply:

- the time points are points in time where associated values are given
- the first time point must be always 0, the last one must be < 24 h,
  because in cyclic usage, the time point at 24 h will be the same as for 0 h (and likewise
  the scheduled values)
- between time points the values are linearly interpolated

<<fig_schedule_dailycycleconstant>> and <<fig_schedule_dailycycleconstant>> illustrate the resulting value curve for time intervals given by _0, 6, 20_ and corresponding parameter values _2, 7, 1_.

.Daily cycle with Constant interpolation mode

[[fig_schedule_dailycyclelinear]]
.Daily cycle with Linear interpolation mode
image::ScheduleDailyCycleLinear.png[pdfwidth=10cm]

[NOTE]
====
When linear interpolation mode is used, the value at 24 h is taken from the start of the next daily cycle, that is defined in the schedule. For example, in <<fig_schedule_week>> the value at Monday 24:00 would be taken from the Tuesday schedule, whereas the value at Wednesday 24:00 would be taken from the regular _AllDays_ schedule.
====

[TIP]
====
To define a single interval for the whole day, simply specify "0" as value in the `TimePoints` XML tag.
====

:xrefstyle: basic 


### Daily Cycle Parameter Values

For each interval given in the `TimePoints` tag, one or more quantities with associated units can be specified. This is done by defining the data table in the XML child tag `Values` of the `DailyCycle` tag. The data table data is formatted as:

----
    quantity1 [unit]:val11 val12 val13; quantity2 [unit]:val21 val22 val23;...
----

Basically, each physical quantity is encoded in a string, whereby the strings for different quantities are combined into one string with ; (semi-colon) as separation character.

Each quantity string is composed of a header and the actual values. The values are simply values separated by spaces/tabs or comma (decimal numbers are written with . as decimal separator).


The header is a quantity keyword (see also <<schedule_variable_list>>) followed by its unit in brackets. So, for example, a heating set point temperature will have the header `HeatingSetPointTemperature [C]` and the values are then given in degree C.

There must be _exactly_ as many values given as there are time points in the  `TimePoints` XML tag. You can specify as many quantities as you need in this data table.

:xrefstyle: short

<<ex_schedule_dailycycle_quantities>> shows a daily cycle with two scheduled quantities and three intervals.

        HeatingSetPointTemperature [C]:18 22 18
    </Values>
</DailyCycle>

### Avoiding discontinuities / performance improvements

When defining daily cycles with interpolation mode `Constant`, the values will actually jump between intervals. These discontinuities are very expensive to compute, since the solver needs to cluster time steps around these jumps to accurately follow the step functions.

However, for practical applications these steps are often not desired - even though a set point may be switched momentarily to a new value, the resulting physical effect may indeed take a few minutes to be noticeable. This is taken into account when the solver interpretes scheduled values.

Instead of exactly providing the step-wise scheduled values, the solver implements an automatic 2 minute ramping just before the interval end. <<fig_schedule_dailycycle_jumpsmoothing>> illustrates the 2 minute linear ramping applied directly before each new interval.

[[fig_schedule_dailycycle_jumpsmoothing]]
.Ramping/step smoothing applied for dialy cycles with step-wise defined values
image::ScheduleDailyCycleConstant_actual.png[pdfwidth=10cm]

[NOTE]
====
The ramping time distance of 2 minutes is currently hard-coded in the schedules calculation routine and can be changed to a larger or smaller value if needed. Also, instead of a linear ramping function a polynomial 3rd order curve can be used (whatever brings best performance-accuracy compromise).
====

[CAUTION]
====
Internally, the step-smoothing is implemented by inserting a new data point 2 minutes before the interval end with the same value as in the current interval. Then, the daily cycle is treated as a linearly interpolated daily cycle. However, there is no check for interval lengths less than 2 minutes. Hence, you *must not* define intervals shorter or equal to 2 minutes when defining dialy cycles with interpolation mode `Linear`.
====

[[annualSchedules]]
## Annual schedules 

Annual schedules are basically data tables with monotonically increasing X (time)-values. Each annual schedule defines a single quantity. For example, hourly values of temperatures or control variables measured during the year can be specified. 

[TIP]
====
The name _annual schedule_ is actually a bit misleading. In these data tables you can place data with arbitrary time ranges, spanning only a few weeks or even several years (using monitoring data, for example). The only requirement is, that the simulation time interval fits into the time span of the schedule.
====

The values provided by the linear spline can be defined as linear/constant interpolated values, however, due to performance reasons constant interpolation mode should be avoided.

[NOTE]
====
For linear splines, step-smoothing is *not* applied by the solver. It is up to the user to provide suitable data or be punished by slow simulation times.
====

Inside the XML tag `AnnualSchedules` there are one or more `ScheduleGroup` XML child tags, each with a mandatory XML attribute `objectList`. Just as with daily cycle schedules, this references an object list and herewith objects, that the scheduled variables apply to. <<ex_AnnualSchedule>> shows an example for annual schedules defined within a single `ScheduleGroup`.
