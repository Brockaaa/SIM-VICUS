# SIM-VICUS

https://sim-vicus.de hosts the official webpage with user-centered information. Development-related information is stored and handled on github.

## Quality Assurance

We have continuous integration scripts running (build-test of all C/C++ code) and solver regression tests. For details, see [Jenkins](https://baukli01.arch.tu-dresden.de/jenkins).

CI tests are located in directory `data/tests`. See [developer documentation](https://ghorwin.github.io/SIM-VICUS/Developer-Documentation/index.html) for information about the Python test suite scripts.

### Validation

The NANDRAD solver is thoroughly validated with the [SimQuality test suite](https://simquality.de) and other published validation test cases.
The validation suite(s) are in directory `data/validation` with summary given on the [Validation-Wiki-readme](https://github.com/ghorwin/SIM-VICUS/tree/master/data/validation/SimQuality) page.

## Repo-Documentation

The `README.md` files are written with MarkDown syntax, GitHub flavour, so that they can be read in the web-view of github.
All extensive documentation is written in AsciiDoctor format inside the doc directory.

Source code documentation is done with Doxygen, which generates its documentation for the _entire_ source code and stores
the output in `docs/api`. For this purpose run the `NandradSolver.doxyfile` in the `NandradSolver/doc` directory through Doxygen.

### Libraries

NANDRAD uses a bunch of external/third-party libraries:

* **CCM** - _Climate Calculation Module_ (CCM), implements climate data loading and calculation of solar radiation loads
* **DataIO** - utility lib for writing DataIO output containers (needed when profiles across wall constructions are written)
* **IBK** - core utility library, extends c++ standard library by useful functions (so we do not need boost and other heavy libs)
* **IBKMK** - IBK math kernel lib, low level optimized routines for efficient number crunching
* **IDFReader** - library for IDF file parsing and data import to VICUS
* **IntegratorFramework** - library that includes several numerical interation libraries and provides a convenient framework to error-controlled time integration
* **ITSOL2** - implements ILUT preconditioner (included in IntegratorFramework, this directory contains the original sources)
* **Nandrad** - the data model library (project handling)
* **Shading** - implements shading factors calculation
* **SuiteSparse** - implements sparse direct solver KLU
* **sundials** - includes CVODE integrator, and GMRES and BiCGStab iterative les solvers
* **TiCPP** - TinyXML parser library, used for reading/writing XML files
* **Zeppelin** - graphing library (see [Graf Zeppelin](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Zeppelin) :-), needed to determine evaluation order of the NANDRAD model objects

Libraries related to UI development:

* **QtExt** - Qt extension library, lots of utility functions and widgets to assist with UI development
* **QuaZIP** - zip file support library
* **qwt** - plotting library
* **Vicus** - the data model for the user interface and overall geometry/BIM data
