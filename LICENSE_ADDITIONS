                    SIM-VICUS/NANDRAD LICENSE ADDITIONS

                         Version 1, 01 March 2020

This document lists additional license terms that apply in addition
to the GPL this programm and its libraries are licensed with
(see LICENSE).


                          Additional Terms

The NANDRAD Data Model and its documentation, in particular the
NANDRAD file format, object hierarchy and structure are a central
part of the software. The GPL regulations shall apply to these
software parts, data models and specifications, as well.

This effectively means that generating NANDRAD project files and
running the solver from a third party tool makes
specific use of copyrighted technology and is considered equal to 
using the NANDRAD data model library for transfer of simulation
data to the solver. 

Because of this, programs/libraries calling the solver have to
placed under a compatibly open-source license, also. This extends to
cascading program execution. Hence, you may not write a 
propriatory/close-source program that calls an open source program 
that in turn calls the NANDRAD solver (or any other sequence of 
programs/libraries calling each other).

The idea behind this is, that the NANDRAD solver cannot be taken and 
just being shipped with some commercial product for any length of time. 
Hereby, there would be no incentive to further support the development. 
Rather, the simulation community shall be encouraged
to develop equally free software/tools that make use of NANDRAD 
technology. Or, even better, interested partys shall join the 
development of SIM-VICUS rather than create their own frontend.

Dresden, 01 March 2020, the SIM-VICUS developers.
