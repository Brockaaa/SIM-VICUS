The *SimQuality* test suite checks for correct calculation of individual 
model aspects and combined effects.

The test suite is organized in test cases (german "TestFall" hence "TF" prefix of directories),
with usually several simulation projects.

The subdirectory `climate` contains climate data files in `c6b` format (created as 
described in the test suite).

The directory `scripts` contains python scripts that assist in converting simulation results
into the result files as required by the test suite.
