This directory contains reference results to test against.

Note: THERAKLES reference results hold flux values in [W/m2], which are scaled by
      the window area of 5.04 m2 in PostProc. To plot these scaled values
      alongside the fluxes computed from NANDRAD 2, the header units have been
      changed to [W].
