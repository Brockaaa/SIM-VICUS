/*! Defines an output definition.
	The VICUS output definition is very similar to the NANDRAD::OutputDefinition data structure, but
	contains some more properties needed for the user interface.

	In NANDRAD, the output definition contains a variable name that encodes also the index in case
	of vector-valued results. The source object is identified via flexibly defined object lists.

	The object lists are not available in the VICUS user interface - currently, there is no support for
	object lists defined by the user. Instead, object lists are created on-the-fly when needed.

	Hence, we need to store information about the source object separetely, so that during the NANDRAD project
	export we can create object lists for similarly referenced output source objects.

	Example:
	- we define a zonal output "AirTemperature"
	- the user selects zones 1,5 and 10 as object sources

	The data for output definitions matches that from the output_reference_list.txt generated during NANDRAD solver init.

	Note: OutputDefinitions are globbed during NANDRAD project export into groups sorted by used grid, time type,
		  source object type and quantity, since these define a unique NANDRAD::OutputDefinition.
		  Within the VICUS project, such definitions should be stored uniquely, yet, it does not harm if there
		  are duplicates, since these will be merged during the grouping process.
