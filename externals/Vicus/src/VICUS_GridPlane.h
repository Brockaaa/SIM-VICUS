/*! Contains definition of a single grid plane and related functionality.

	A grid plane is defined by the offset (always in the middle), its normal vector and
	local X vector, that defines the orientation.

	The dimension of the grid plane is defined by width (total width) and the major grid spacing.
	The width is automatically adjusted to hold an even number number of grid spacings.
	For example, if the grid is defined with a width of 125 m, and grid spacing is 10 m, than
	the final grid will extend from -70..70 covering a total of 140 m.

	The minor grid spacing is computed automatically to be 1/10 of the major grid.
