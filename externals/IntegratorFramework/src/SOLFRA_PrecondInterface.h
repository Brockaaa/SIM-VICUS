	/*! Function implementing CVSpilsPrecSolveFn.

		The user-supplied preconditioner solve function PrecSolve
		is to solve a linear system P z = r in which the matrix P is
		one of the preconditioner matrices P1 or P2, depending on the
		type of preconditioning chosen.

		A function PrecSolve must have the prototype given below.
		Its parameters are as follows:

		\param t      is the current value of the independent variable.

		\param y      is the current value of the dependent variable vector.

		\param fy     is the vector f(t,y).

		\param r      is the right-hand side vector of the linear system.

		\param z      is the output vector computed by PrecSolve.

		\param gamma  is the scalar appearing in the Newton matrix.

		\param delta  is an input tolerance for use by PSolve if it uses
			   an iterative method in its solution.  In that case,
			   the residual vector Res = r - P z of the system
			   should be made less than delta in weighted L2 norm,
			   i.e., sqrt [ Sum (Res[i]*ewt[i])^2 ] < delta.
			   Note: the error weight vector ewt can be obtained
			   through a call to the routine CVodeGetErrWeights.

		\param lr     is an input flag indicating whether PrecSolve is to use
			   the left preconditioner P1 or right preconditioner
			   P2: lr = 1 means use P1, and lr = 2 means use P2.

		\param user_data  is a pointer to user data - the same as the user_data
				parameter passed to the CVodeSetUserData function.

		\param tmp    is a pointer to memory allocated for an N_Vector
			   which can be used by PSolve for work space.

		\return Returned value:
		The value to be returned by the PrecSolve function is a flag
		indicating whether it was successful.  This value should be
		  0 if successful,
		  positive for a recoverable error (step will be retried),
		  negative for an unrecoverable error (integration is halted).
