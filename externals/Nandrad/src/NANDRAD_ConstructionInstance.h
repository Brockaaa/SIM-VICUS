/*!	\brief Defines a wall/floor/ceiling instance.

	A ConstructionInstance selects all information about a wall that are needed for wall
	temperature simulation and loads from windows.

	Geometry of the wall is stored inside the parameter list. For calculation needed are
	wall orientation and inclination, the complete wall area including windows dores and
	openings and the window are (area of all windows of the wall including frame). The
	window area always should be smaller than the wall area! A window area that equals
	the wall area is interpreted as a wall consisting of only windows without an
	construction behind.

	Each constructionInstance stores its surface information inside the interface vector.
	Maximum two interfaces are allowed, each of them characterized with the attribute
	either Interface::type_t::IT_LEFT or Interface::type_t::IT_RIGHT. A non-existent interface
	is equivalent to an adiabatic wall surface.

	Construction and window information is referenced due to a single construction type and
	window type id number. Only one window type and only one shading type are allowed. The
	shading type is automatically linked to all windows of the wall.
