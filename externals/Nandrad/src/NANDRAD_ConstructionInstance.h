/*!	\brief Defines a wall/floor/ceiling construction instance.

	A ConstructionInstance selects all information about a wall that are needed for wall
	temperature simulation and loads from windows.

	Geometry of the wall is stored inside the parameter list. For calculation needed are
	wall orientation and inclination, the complete wall area including windows dores and
	openings and the window are (area of all windows of the wall including frame). The
	window area always should be smaller than the wall area! A window area that equals
	the wall area is interpreted as a wall consisting of only windows without an
	construction behind.

	Each construction instance stores its surface information inside interface data structures
	for side A and side B. Side A is besides construction layer index 0.
	By default, an interface has no boundary condition information (model types are set to undefined)
	and hence no fluxes are calculated.
	There must be at least one interface with valid boundary condition parametrization for a construction
	instance to be valid.

	Construction and window information is referenced due to a single construction type and
	window type id number. Only one window type and only one shading type are allowed. The
	shading type is automatically linked to all windows of the wall.
