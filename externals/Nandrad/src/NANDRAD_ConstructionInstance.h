/*!	Defines a wall/floor/ceiling construction instance.

	A ConstructionInstance contains all information about a wall and possibly embedded objects
	like windows.

	Note that the area parameter stores the gross area of the wall, including all embedded objects.
	Naturally, their area must not exceed the wall area.
	A window area that is equal to the wall area is interpreted as a wall consisting of only windows
	without a construction behind.

	Each construction instance stores its surface information inside interface data structures
	for side A and side B. Side A is besides construction layer with index 0.
	By default, an interface has no boundary condition information (model types are set to undefined)
	and hence no fluxes are calculated.
	There must be at least one interface with valid boundary condition parametrization for a construction
	instance to be valid. Not referenced wall constructions will still be calculated, as they may
	serve as storage medium or provide sensor data. However, if not needed, they should be removed
	to improve performance.
