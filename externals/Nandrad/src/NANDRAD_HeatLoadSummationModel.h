/*! A model for summation of heat load from different zones, construction instances or networks.
	The resulting heat load summation value represents the energy flux towards (positive) or from (negative)
	the considered balance variables.

	The object list, or rather the reference type used by the object list, uniquely determines
	the model result variables that are accumulated:

	ConstructionInstance:
	- ConstructionInstance.ActiveLayerThermalLoad

	NetworkElement:
	- NetworkElement.HeatLoss

	Zone:
	- Zone.IdealHeatingLoad
	- Zone.IdealCoolingLoad  (defined as positive quantity, even though it is a negative energy constribution
							  to the zone energy balance)

	The signs of the values for NetworkElement.HeatLoss and Zone.IdealCoolingLoad are inverted so that positive
	summation values represet a net gain of energy in the group of considered objects.

	As can be seen, in the case of Zone as reference type, there are two variables, which may or
	may not be used in the model. This is distinguished by an additional variable: useZoneCoolingLoad.

	Note: with one model parametrization block you may not sum up *both* IdealHeatingLoad and IdealCoolingLoad.
