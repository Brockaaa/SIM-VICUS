	The quantity can be used for further classify the type of sensor. In some cases, like
	in case of radiation sensors, the quantity can be omitted since placing the sensor
	will automatically generate 4 quantities (direct, diffuse, global radiations and incidence angle).
	The use of the quantity depends on the model implementing sensor support.
