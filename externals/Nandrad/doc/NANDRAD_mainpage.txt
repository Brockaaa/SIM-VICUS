\mainpage The NANDRAD Data Model Library

\section intro_sec Overview

The NANDRAD library stores the data model used exclusively by the 
NandradSolver. *All* project data  (with the exception of externally 
referenced climate data files) are stored within the data structure
of the NANDRAD library.

The core class, which stores data objects of all other classes is
the NANDRAD::Project. This class is a good starting point to learn 
about the library.

The actual data model (i.e. the physical meaning of the various parameters and
how to describe the model) is well documented in the [NANDRAD-Model and Implementation Docs]
(https://ghorwin.github.io/SIM-VICUS/NANDRAD-Model-Reference/index.html).

\section serialization Serialization of project data (i.e. reading/writing of `nandrad` project files)

The NANDRAD data model is stored in `.nandrad` project files, which are in XML format.

Without a few exceptions the relevant functions `readXML()` and `writeXML()` are not
explicitely programmed, but automatically generated by our code generator 
(see [NANDRAD Code Generator docs](https://ghorwin.github.io/SIM-VICUS/NANDRAD-CodeGenerator/index.html) ). The automatically generated implementation
files are stored in the `src/ncg` subdirectory and are prefixed `ncg_`.
