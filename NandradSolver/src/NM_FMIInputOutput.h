/*! Central interface class for FMU export/import of the *entire* NANDRAD model.

	This class provides a set of input variables (basically fakes variable results as
	created by other models) and collects output quantities (just as regular outputs).

	The FMUInputOutput object is special and not handled as other models - both in initialization
	(variable lookup) as in calculation. Its state changes descretely only through calls from
	the FMI master. Output variables are retrieved only when requested by the master.

	\note This object only implements AbstractModel to avoid code duplication in NandradModel::initModelDependencies().
		The functions are not implemented and should/must never be called.

		This function looks through the list of published FMI input variables and parameters and
		checks, if any of these matches the requested variable.

		For example, if the input variable name is "Zone[14].AirTemperature", this corresponds to
		an input references of:
		- reference type = MRT_ZONE
		- id = 14
		- variable name = AirTemperature

		If you want to provide an input variable for an object list, you can write: "All zones.HeatingSetPoint"
		where an object list exists with name "All zones", referenzing zones with any ID (*). Then, the variable will
		be matched by any request with:
		- reference type = MRT_ZONE
		- id = * (any)
		- variable name = HeatingSetPoint

		Hereby, a potentially existing HeatingSetPoint schedule can be overwritten (or provided, if missing).

		\return Returns a persistent pointer to the storage location or nullptr, if the requested
			variable is not provided as FMU input/parameter variable. If not a nullptr, the details of the requested variable
			are stored in quantityDesc.
