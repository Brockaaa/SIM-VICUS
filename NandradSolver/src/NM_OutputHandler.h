/*! Handles all output file initialization and the process of caching and writing
	outputs.

	During simulation, this class is called to store/append outputs whenever an output time point has been
	reached in one of the ouput grids.

	The output handler then notifies all output files to cache new output values (when respective grid is active).
	After some real time (or when output cache exceeds a limit), the output handler requests the output files
	to flush their caches.

	Output files are created on first call.

	\note Note that output handler operates with three time points (within writeOutputs()):
	- \a t_out - Output time point in [s] in simulation time (i.e. starts with 0 when solver starts). \a t_out is
		needed for interpolating integral values and is passed to output files when writing outputs (to cache).
	- \a t_secondsOfYear - Time point in [s] relative to Midnight January 1st of start year (t_out + startTime offset).
		\a t_timeOfYear is written in first column of output files and is also passed to output files
	- \a t_timeOfYear - Time point in [<output unit>] converted from t_secondsOfYear.
		\a t_secondsOfYear is used to check if an output grid is active.
