/*! Provides access to scheduled quantities.
	Schedules provide by default only time-dependent values with no dependence on other
	objects. Also, the evaluation is guaranteed to be done prior to any other models.

	During initialization, the data from NANDRAD::Schedules is cached in this object such, that is can
	be accessed by other models very efficiently. During the initialization, it is checked that:
	- all schedules have definitions for a full time range (i.e. all days types are covered)
	- each object list is referenced only once

	Important:
	- Schedules are implemented as linear splines; when these are composed, the values given in DailyCycles
	  are converted to the base SI unit. Thus, values retrieved from schedules are *always* in base-SI unit
