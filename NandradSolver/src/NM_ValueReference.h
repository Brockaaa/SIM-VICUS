/*! Data type that uniquely identifies a (result) variable.

	Reference type (m_referenceType) and id (m_id) identify the object that generates the data.
	Variable name (m_name) identifies the name of the variable to retrieve (may be a vector-valued variable name, without
	index of course).

	This data structure is used to determine the object a variable is requested from. The results
	from all objects/model instances are stored in a map (from variable reference to object), hence
	the operator< in this class. It is actually an extended QuantityDescription, but with additional comparison
	operator, that allows its efficient use in a map.

	When looking up requested input variables from models, we simply search for this value reference, and hereby determine
	object and id and eventually get the object instance that provides the variable we need. Then, we can ask
	the object instance to give us a persistent pointer to the result variable's memory location.
