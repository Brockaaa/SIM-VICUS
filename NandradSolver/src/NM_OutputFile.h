/*! Handles writing of a single tsv output file.
	This class implements the model interface and requests input references for
	all output quantities stored in the output file managed by this class.

	The class also implements the AbstractTimeStateDependency interface, in order to
	receive stepCompleted() calls, needed for time intergration.

	To add OutputFile objects to the model container of NandradModel we need
	to derive from AbstractModel, even though output files never generate results. Hence,
	the implementation of the AbstractModel interface is just dummy code.


	Initialization of OutputFiles is a bit tricky, since not all information is available during setup:

	1. the object is created and mandatory parameters are stored (filename and output definitions)
	2. call to createInputReferences() which composes input references from output definition. One output definition
	   may expand to several input references, depending on object list ID filters. The mapping from input variable
	   vector to original output definition is stored in m_outputDefMap.
	3. the framework calls setInputValueRef(), and provides meta data about requested parameters (like the input/output unit).
	   Only now we have all information to write the file header and retrieve output values.
	   Once the last variable ref has been provided, we initialize the integral values, if integrals/mean values are requested.
	4. the framework calls stepCompleted(), where we start integrating out values.
	5. before the first call to writeOutputs(), the framework calls createFile(), where we create/reopen the file
	6. the framework calls writeOutputs(), where we cache output data
	7. the framework calls flushCache() (after some time) and we dump the collected values to file.
